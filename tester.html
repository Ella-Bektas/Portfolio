          <h2>UX Design Case Study</h2>
          <h1>Redesigning the Sports Lancaster Booking App</h1>
          <p>Redesigned Lancaster University's sport booking app using user-centred design principles to improve usability, resulting in 50% faster task completion.</p>

      <div class="box5"><h2>Project Summary</h2><p>This was a conceptual University project conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic as a part of my design interactions module. This was a 10-week solo project where I took on multiple roles, including the UX designer, UI designer and researcher.</p><br><p>There were however, some limitations such as: the project was conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic, all research had to be virtual and there was no access to the analytics of the current app</p></div>
      <div class="box4"> <img src="beforeandafter.png" alt="Before and After" class="hero-image"></div>
      <div class="box5"><h2>The Problem</h2><p>I analysed the usability of the current platform by conducting a usability audit, where I broke down each part of the user journey an highlighted the pain points. The problem was, the booking process was taking users so much time that users stopped using in the app. This resulted in members attending the gym without a slot, which was causing problems for the staff.</p></div>
      <div class="box4"> <img src="problems.png" alt="Problems" class="hero-image"></div>
      <div class="box5"><h2>User Interviews and Usability Testing</h2><p>After trying out the app myself, I asked 10 students to show me how they would use the booking system - via Teams screen share. I then asked the participants to discuss their experience. Once I had gathered the feedback, I used a thematic analysis to define the key blockers to success, which were the following themes: Usability, Time, Navigation and Confusion</p></div>
      <div class="box6"> <img src="thematicanalysis.png" alt="Thematic Analysis" class="hero-image"></div>
      <div class="box5"><hr><br><h2>User Goal</h2><p>To be able to book a gym session quickly and easily on their phone without wasting time.</p><h2>Business Goal</h2><p>Encourage student members to use the booking app, to prevent the gym facilities being overcrowded, during COVID.</p><br><br><hr></div>
    
      <div class="box5"><h2>Defining Progress Metrics</h2><p>Whilst shadowing the users, I manually timed how long it took them to book a gym session as well as the number of clicks it took. Ideally, I would be able to track these metrics via an integrated analytics software, e.g google analytics, however, this was not feasible. These metrics played an important part in seeing whether my design solutions had any impact.</p></div>
      <div class="box6"> <img src="progressmetrics.png" alt="Progress Metrics" class="hero-image"></div>
 
      <div class="box5"><h2>Result of Research</h2><p>1.There were too many unnecessary steps involved and users often had to swap back and forth between pages to get to the right one, this was due to the glitching of the app.</p><br><p>2. Users found it difficult to see which gym slots were actually available</p><br><p>3. Users found it difficult to check their university calendar against the availability of the gym, they had to keep swapping between apps to do this.</p></div>

      <div class="box5"><h2>User Flows</h2><p>Once identifying the key user problems and goals, I developed the most simple user flow. This flow would allow users to complete their tasks in the fewest steps.</p></div>
      <div class="box3"> <img src="userflows.png" alt="User Flow" class="hero-image"></div>
      <div class="box5"><h2>Usability Testing</h2><p>I then went through a rigorous design ideation stage, where I developed several sketches of different wireframes of the app. Once I had found an Idea I wanted to test, I created a digital prototype using the Marvel app. This prototype was sent to 5 users, to which I observed them use the prototype and gathered feedback.</p></div>
      <div class="box3"> <img src="feedback.png" alt="Feedback" class="hero-image"></div>
      <div class="box5"><h2>Feedback from the Prototype</h2><p>Overall, there were few points where the user struggled to find what they needed</p><br><p>The ‘What would you like to book page’ took users slightly longer, may need icons</p><br><p>The final page did not give users the opportunity to go back to the homepage</p></div>
      <div class="box5"><hr></div>
      <div class="box5"><h2>Final Prototype</h2></div>
      <div class="box3"> <img src="finalwireframe.png" alt="Final Wireframe" class="hero-image"></div>
      <div class="box5"><h2>Defininf the Design System</h2><p>To help develop the final wireframes of the app, I created a design system, based off the branding of Lancaster University and their App, iLancaster. The reason for this was to help students recognise the design, through affordances which would then improve the user experience. I also took inspiration from popular apps amongst university students.</p></div>
      <div class="box3"> <img src="designsystem.png" alt="Design System" class="hero-image"></div>
      <div class="box5"><h2>The Results</h2><p>Once the final design was ready, I went through another round of user testing where I manually tracked how long it took users to use the new prototype. The results were: 46% quicker task completion and 51% less clicks.</p></div>
